It is known as Finzel Road and covers a distance of 3.61 miles (5.81 km) from Beall School Road, situated south of an interchange with Interstate 68 (I-68) and U.S. Route 40 (US 40) in Finzel, which is located in northeastern Garrett County. The highway extends north to the Pennsylvania state line, where it continues as State Route 2010 (SR 2010) in Somerset County. MD 546 was constructed in the early 1930s. MD 946 used to follow the southern part, but its terminus was shifted west when I-68 was constructed in the early 1970s. In 2015, the route was extended a short distance south of the I-68 interchange.\n\nRoute description\nMD 546 begins at an intersection of Beall School Road and Mels Road, heading northeast on two-lane undivided Finzel Road. The road continues south past the terminus as Beall School Road.  A short distance to the northeast, the road intersects the ramps to and from eastbound I-68 and US 40 (National Freeway). MD 546 crosses I-68 then intersects the exit ramp from eastbound I-68 and unsigned MD 546F, a two-way access road to westbound I-68 and US 40 and US 40 Alternate (National Pike). The state highway passes over US 40 Alternate and continues northeast as a two-lane undivided road to an intersection with MD 946 (Finzel Road), the old alignment of MD 546. MD 546 continues north along the ridgeline of Little Savage Mountain through scattered residences and farmland to its northern terminus at the Pennsylvania state line.  The highway continues north as SR 2010 (Greenville Road) through Greenville Township.\n\nHistory\nMD 546 was constructed as a modern highway in 1933.  The state highway originally followed what is now MD 946 to its southern terminus at a standard intersection with US 40 (now US 40 Alternate).  MD 946's overpass of US 40 was constructed in 1956 when US 40 was relocated over Little Savage Mountain.  MD 546 was relocated to its southern terminus at an interchange with I-68 when the highway's interchange was completed in 1974. In 2015, MD 546 was extended south from the I-68 interchange to the intersection of Beall School Road and Mels Road.\n\nJunction list\nThe entire route is in Finzel, Garrett County.\n\nAuxiliary route\nMD 546F is the designation for the unnamed 0.43-mile (0.69 km) access road between MD 546 and US 40 Alternate.  The access road includes an entrance ramp to westbound I-68.  MD 546F was constructed as part of MD 546's interchange with I-68 around 1974.\n\nSee also\nMaryland Roads portal\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nMDRoads: MD 546"}

This siege was led by Alfonso the Battler against the Almoravid-controlled city of Lleida.\n\nBackground\nFollowing the loss of Zaragoza in 1118, the city of Lleida was under threat by Alfonso the Battler. For unknown reasons, Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona, established an alliance with the governor of Lleida, Abu Hilal. Ramon acted as the defender against any attack by Alfonso. Abu Hilal would cede castles to Ramon in exchange for help against his own enemies and would pay tribute to Ramon. After securing western borders with the Leonese kingdom, the Aragonese king, Alfonso the Battler, made preparations against Lleida.\n\nSiege\nIn February 1123, the Aragonese king marched to Lleida. The conquest of Lleida could reestablish an alliance with the County of Urgell. Alfosno constructed a castle called Gardeny on a hill above the city. The Aragonese forces used the castle they built to blockade the city, cutting off the supplies that were delivered through the Segre River, and trap its inhabitants. However, this strategy faced obstacles as the Almoravid garrison showed strong resistance. Relief forces led by Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona, and William IX, Duke of Aquitaine, arrived. Alfonso engaged in a battle or a tournament with Ramon and William, which ended in Alfonso raising the siege in May 1123.\n\nReferences\nSources\nClay Stalls (2022), Possessing the Land, Aragon's Expansion Into Islam's Ebro Frontier Under Alfonso the Battler (1104–1134).[1]\nThomas W.

He was the managing director of Maruti Udyog Limited from 1999 to 2007. He first joined Maruti in July 1993 as a director (marketing). He was appointed managing director in 1999 as the government nominee, and reappointed in May 2002 as the Suzuki Motor Corporation (SMC) nominee.  During his tenure, he oversaw a restructuring of the company in the face of foreign competitors entering the Indian market.\nPrior to joining Maruti, Khattar was an officer of the Indian Administrative Service for more than 27 years.  In 2008, he decided to set up an independent national sales and service network in the automobile sector, which became Carnation Auto.\n\nEarly life\nKhattar was born on 18 December 1942 into a family of entrepreneurs who had set up an electricity generation and supply company in Dera Ismail Khan (now in Pakistan) before Partition. He completed his Bachelor of Arts (Honours) degree from St. Stephen's College, Delhi and his LLB from Delhi University.\n\nCareer\nKhattar was an Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer of the Uttar Pradesh cadre. As a bureaucrat he served as the officer of the Uttar Pradesh state government between 1965 and 1979, during which he served as the district magistrate of Chamoli between 1969 and 1972, and the managing director of the Uttar Pradesh State Industrial Development Corporation between 1975 and 1978.

C. Bhargava. He joined the company in 1993 as a director of marketing and went on to become its executive director before being promoted to being its joint managing director in 1999. This was the time of differences between Suzuki Motor Corporation and the Government of India which were joint venture partners in the company. He was noted to have laid the foundation of the company's growth after the Indian government began its disinvestment from the joint venture in 2002. During this period of disagreement between the venture partners, Khattar dealt with issues on ownership, technology transfer, as well as industrial relations including a workers strike in the Gurgaon plant of the company in 2000. In 2002, he was re-nominated as the managing director by Suzuki Motor Corporation and served as the managing director until his retirement in 2007. At the time of his retirement, the company had more than fifty percent of the market share of the Indian passenger vehicles market. He was also noted for his representations of the Indian auto industry for changes in taxation structure and regulations with the government, working with the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).\nHis last day in office at Maruti as MD, at age 65, was on 18 December 2007. After his retirement from Maruti Udyog in 2007, he founded Carnation Auto, a multi-brand car service chain with investments from Premji Invest and Gaja Capital. He was charged by the CBI and Carnation Auto  in 2019 of causing losses of INR 110 crores to the Indian public sector bank, Punjab National Bank.

Her standing epithet is \"world-furthering\" or \"world-promoting.\"\n\nIn scripture\nAlthough there is a yasht nominally dedicated to Arshtat (Yasht 18), this hymn does not mention her, and it has been supposed that \"the occurrence of arš- 'correct' may have been the reason\" for the dedication.\nArshtat is closely allied with \"the most upright\" Rashnu, the \"Judge.\" The two appear as a dvandva compound \"Rashnu-Arshtat\" in Yasna 1.7 and 2.7, in Yasht 10.139 and 12.40, and in Sirozeh 1.18 and 2.18. This is an eschatological identification, and in the liturgy recited on the third day after death she is invoked with Rashnu, Sraosha \"Obedience\" and Mithra \"Covenant\", together the three guardians of the Chinvat bridge.\nIn Sirozeh 1.26 and 2.26, Arshtat is invoked as the divinity presiding over the 26th day of the month (cf. Zoroastrian calendar). Both verses associate her with the mythical Mount Ushidarena the \"keeper of intelligence\" that in Zoroastrian tradition is where Zoroaster spent his years in isolation. Yasna 16.6 states the 26th day of the month is sacred to her.\nArshtat is once (Visperad 7.2) identified with Daena (generally translated as \"Religion\").\n\nIn tradition\nArshtat's eschatological role is carried forward into the 9th–14th century texts of Zoroastrian tradition, where she appears as Middle Persian Ashtad.\nArshtat is an assayer of deeds at the Chinvat bridge, the bridge of judgement that all souls must cross. in Bundahishn (37.10–14), Arshtat plays this role together with the Amesha Spenta Ameretat, of whom Arshtat is a hamkar \"co-operator\"; and in the Book of Arda Wiraz (5.3), she stands there with Mithra, Rashnu, Vayu-Vata, and Verethragna.\nIn the apocalyptic Zand-i Wahman yasn (7.19-20), Arshtat—together with Nairyosangha, Mithra, Rashnu, Verethregna, Sraosha and a personified Khwarenah—assists the hero Peshyotan.\n\nReferences\n\n\n== Bibliography =="}

Дочь Аугусто Суджа (1851—1932), виолончелиста и профессора Лиссабонской консерватории.\n\nБиография\nГильермина Аугуста Хавьер де Медин Суджа родилась в Порту в семье итальянского происхождения. Ее отец был компетентным музыкантом и преподавал ей музыкальную теорию и виолончель. К 12 годам она была назначена главной виолончелисткой местного оркестра, Orpheon Portuense. В 1904 году под покровительством португальской королевы Марии Амелии она отправилась учиться в Лейпцигскую консерваторию у Юлиуса Кленгеля, выступала как солистка в юбилейном концерте к столетию оркестра Гевандхауз. В 1907—1913 гг. жила в Париже вместе с Пабло Казальсом. В 1914—1924 гг. жила и выступала преимущественно в Великобритании, к этому периоду относится её знаменитый портрет работы Огастеса Джона. В 1914 году она сформировала трио со скрипачкой Джелли д’Араньи и пианисткой Фанни Дэвис.

Проявление этого эффекта затрудняет метеорологические прогнозы и увеличивает риск человеческих жертв. В более общем случае под эффектом Фудзивары могут подразумеваться взаимодействия двух и более вихрей с совпадающим направлением вращения.\nВ 1921 году японский метеоролог С. Фудзивара (Sakuhei Fujiwhara) опубликовал описания экспериментальных исследований взаимодействующих вихрей, проведённых им в лаборатории профессора В. Бьеркнеса. Продолжая работу по этой теме, он провёл также экспериментальные наблюдения, заключив, что циклоны, расположенные на расстояниях до 1000 км друг от друга, имеют склонность сближаться, их центры начинают вращаться вокруг некоторой точки, расположенной между центрами (позже Bernhard Haurwitz ввёл понятие центра масс), после чего с течением времени циклоны могут слиться в один. Позже явление взаимодействия двух (со временем также более чем двух) циклонов было названо в его честь. На сегодняшний день считается, что максимальное расстояние между циклонами, на котором проявляется эффект Фудзивары, составляет 1400км, но существуют и другие оценки, говорящие о взаимном влиянии циклонов, расположенных на расстоянии до 2700 км. Также на сегодняшний день упоминаются три разновидности эффекта.\nНекоторые двойные циклоны со значительными проявлениями эффекта Фудзивары:\n\nАтлантические циклоны «Конни» и «Диана» в 1955 году сформировались близко друг к другу и в некоторый момент времени выглядели как один огромный ураган, двигаясь вокруг друг друга против часовой стрелки. Малый промежуток между ураганами привёл к тому, что уровень воды в реках, поднявшийся после дождей, вызванных ураганом Конни, не успел опуститься, и ливни, принесённые ураганом Диана, привели к сильным наводнениям. В результате ураганов Конни и Диана погибло соответственно 25 и 200 человек, а Диана оказалась первым ураганом, причинившим миллиардный убыток.\nТихоокеанские ураганы «Кирстен» и «Ион» 1974 года в какой-то момент соединились друг с другом высотной ложбиной, но впоследствии отдалились друг от друга и разошлись.\nАтлантический циклон «Айрис» в 1995 подвергся воздействию эффекта Фудзивары дважды, последовательно провзаимодействовав с ураганами «Умберто» и «Карен» (последний в результате ослабел и был поглощён «Айрис»). Привёл к гибели 5 человек.\nТайфуны «Мелор» и «Парма» в 2009 году в северной части Тихого океана. Как было показано позже, из-за их взаимодействия «Парма» увеличила свою силу и неоднократно изменила направление движения, трижды пройдя по филиппинскому острову Лусон, что сделало предсказание её движения численными методами крайне затруднительной задачей, и потому число погибших на острове достигло 500 человек. По-видимому, после этих тайфунов явления, связанные с Эль-Ниньо, спровоцировали большее, чем обычно, число оползней.\n\n\n== Примечания =="}

Представитель японской литературы позднего Средневековья. Прославился новеллами в жанре ёмихон (буквально — «книга для чтения»). Наиболее известны его сборники рассказов «Луна в тумане» (1768) и «Рассказы о весеннем дожде» (1809).\n\nБиография\nМать — проститутка из Осаки, отец неизвестен. На четвёртом году жизни Уэда был усыновлён богатым торговцем, который обеспечил ему комфортные условия жизни и дал хорошее образование. Ещё будучи ребёнком, Уэда переболел оспой. Хотя он выжил, пальцы на его руках были обезображены болезнью. Уэда верил, что выздоровел благодаря богу святилища Касима-Инари (яп. 加島稲荷), которому его родители молились во время его болезни. В течение всей жизни он верил в сверхъестественное; видимо, это отразилось и в произведениях писателя, в том числе в самой известной его работе — сборнике рассказов о духах и привидениях «Луна в тумане».\nУэда унаследовал семейные предприятия после смерти приёмного отца, но не стал удачным торговцем. За 10 лет Уэда опубликовал несколько юмористических историй в жанре «укиё-дзоси» (дословно — «записки о бренном мире»). Когда в его компании случился пожар, он оставил коммерческую деятельность и начал изучать медицину. Его учитель также приобщил Уэду к китайскому литературному фольклору. В 1776 году Уэда начал медицинскую практику и опубликовал сборник «Луна в тумане», что поставило его в один ряд с выдающимися писателями жанра ёмихон, включая Кёкутэя Бакина. В 1760 году Акинари женился на служанке, работавшей в доме его приёмных родителей, по имени Тама Уэяма (яп. 植山たま уэяма тама).\nПомимо художественной литературы, писатель участвовал в движении кокугаку, которое противопоставляло китайским, неоконфуцианским и буддистским текстам самобытность японской культуры и истории. В кругу единомышленников Уэда занял довольно независимую позицию, энергично полемизируя с Мотоори Норинагой, ведущим учёным движения. Есть мнение, что Уэда отразил этот конфликт и в своих историях, в том числе в «Луне в тумане», основывая истории на китайских, выводя затем на передний план японскую чувствительность с помощью сверхъестественных элементов и глубоких эмоций у персонажей (в противовес китайской опоре на интеллект).\nЧерез несколько лет после смерти жены в 1798 году у Уэды наступила временная слепота. И хотя его левый глаз через некоторое время снова стал видеть, писателю пришлось диктовать свои произведения для записи. В это время (около 1802 года) он закончил первые два рассказа из сборника «Рассказы о весеннем дожде». В этом сборнике, в отличие от «Луны в тумане», тема сверхъестественного не играет большой роли, а рассказы существенно различаются по длине.\nУэда также был поэтом, писал стихи в жанре танка и хайку.\nПоследние годы писателя прошли в скитаниях и бедности. Уэда Акинари скончался в 1809 году в Киото.\n\nПроизведения\n1767 — «Нравы бывалых содержанок»\n1776 — «Луна в тумане»\n1809 — «Рассказы о весеннем дожде» (опубликовано в 1907 году, первая полная публикация — в 1950 году)\n\nПубликации\nАкинари Уэда.

Листья молодых растений настолько отличаются внешним видом от листьев взрослого дерева, что в течение долгого времени их относили к разным видам.\n\nОбщий вид растения\nБольшое листопадное дерево, достигающее высоты до 45 м и диаметра ствола до 190 см. Листья молодых растений состоят из трех четко разделенных частей, но становятся сплошными у взрослых растений. Обычно листья 6-22 см (до 30 см) длиной, и 3-17 см шириной. Мужские и женские цветки образуются на отдельных соцветиях. Мужские соцветия копьевидные, 4-12 см длиной. Женские соцветия собраны в компактные кластеры 1-1,5 см в диаметре. Съедобные соплодия 2,5-3,5 см в диаметре.\n\nАреал\nBagassa guianensis распространена в Гайане, Суринаме, Французской Гвиане, в северной части Амазонии, в бразильских штатах Амапа, Пара, Мараньян и Рорайма. Изолированная популяция существует в юго-западной части штатов Мату-Гросу и Рондония.\n\nЭкология\nХотя строение цветков предполагает опыление летучими мышами, некоторые авторы указывают на возможность опыления ветром. Семена разносятся многочисленными животными, такими как обезьяны, птицы, грызуны и черепахи.\n\nСистематика\nBagassa guianensis — единственный представитель монотипного рода Bagassa. Род был описан в 1775 году французским ботаником Жаном Батистом Обле. Описание основывались на молодых листьях и соплодиях. Отдельно от него, основываясь на листе взрослого растения и мужских цветках, французский ботаник Никез Огюстен Дево в 1825 году описал это же растение под названием Piper tiliifolium, а Шарль Годишо — Бопре в 1844 году описал его же под названием Laurea tiliifolia. аймонд Бенуа в 1933 году отнес растение к роду Bagassa, как B. tiliifolia. В 1880 году Луи Эдуар Бюро описал растение, которое он назвал B. sagotiana, основываясь на взрослом листе и женских цветках. Растения с молодыми и взрослыми листьями считались разными видами вплоть до 1975 года, когда голландский систематик Корнелис Берг в работе «Флора Суринама» все ещё сохранял разделение на два отдельных вида. Лишь позднее, недоразумение было исправлено благодаря наблюдениям за деревьями в течение длительного времени.\n\nСинонимы\nРода\n\nLaurea Gaudich.\nВида\n\nBagassa sagotiana Burch. ex Benth. & Hook.f.\nBagassa tiliifolia Benoist — Багасса липолистная\nLaurea tiliifolia Gaudich.\nPiper tiliifolium Desv. ex Ham.\n\n\n== Примечания =="}
