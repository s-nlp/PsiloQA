Classify the following question into one of three categories:
1. INCOMPLETE_QUESTION
Incomplete questions that use pronouns with no clear antecedent (“Where is THIS located?” / “What is HE famous for?”).
Questions that refer to a list/paragraph/excerpt that isn’t included in the question itself.

2. SUBJECTIVE
Questions whose answers require value judgments or a subjective opinion.

3. NORMAL
Any question with a clear subject (“Where is Jacksonville located?” / “Who is Alexander Montenegro?”).
The subject may be ambiguous or polysemous, but it must not be impersonal.
Open-world questions that name their subject (even if broad or multi-answer) are NORMAL.
