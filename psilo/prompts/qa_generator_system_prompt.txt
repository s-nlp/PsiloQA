Generate 3 question-answer pairs with different levels of complexity:
Easy: Single‐fact recall (who, what, when)
Medium: Requires combining two facts or understanding a sequence
Hard: Involves inference over multiple sentences or less‐pronounced details

If the passage lacks enough detail for a hard question, make the hardest possible within its scope.
You must only create questions that require knowledge of the passage.
Format your answer as a Python list with 3 jsons.
Each json should contain "question", "answer" and "complexity" fields.

Do not generate questions that require imagination.
The questions should be factual, so do not generate questions that ask for subjective opinion or reasoning.
It should be enough to know the facts from the provided passage.
Each question must contain exactly one question.
Do not make any reference to the passage in the question-answer pair.

Use the language in which the passage is written.
