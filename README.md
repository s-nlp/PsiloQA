# PsiloQA: Generate multilingual span-level inconsistency detection data synthetically!

## Installation
Install uv:
```bash
pip install uv
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
uv sync --no-dev
```

Copy env.example and fill env variables:
```bash
cp env.example .env
```

## Dataset
The first step in PsiloQA pipeline is getting contexts for QA generation. You can use your own, or, as in out paper, parse random pages from Wikipedia as input contexts. Just run the following command with languages you need. If no `--language` list specified, it will parse random pages for 14 languages presented in our paper. `--num-pages` determines how many contexts to parse from Wikipedia.
```bash
uv run psilo dataset get_contexts --num-pages 10 --language ru --language en
```

Next step is question and answer generation for the obtained contexts. The script generates three questions of different complexity based on provided contexts. Fill `QA_GENERATOR` settings in `.env` file to use this script. By default, `gpt-4o` is used. Feel free to use another models by providing another model name through `QA_GENERATOR` setting in `.env`.
```bash
uv run psilo dataset generate_qa
```

Generate LLM hypotheses:
```bash
uv run psilo dataset generate_llm_answers
```

Annotate hypotheses (fill `ANNOTATOR_OPENAI_API_KEY` variable in .env):
```bash
uv run psilo dataset annotate
```

Filter data
```bash
TBD
```
